# RPG Combat Kata

This repository implements the "RPG Combat Kata" - see [KATA.md](./KATA.md) for the original problem definition I used.

This kata felt like 'real' programming' to me - hopefully making reasonable choices given an uncertain direction.

I wanted to document my thought process as I was experiencing it, in the hope that others might learn from it.

It's often one thing to know code smells, functional programming principles or object-oriented design patterns. It's another problem entirely to know when to apply them in an evolving codebase, and how to refactor safely and incrementally.

You can see the messiness, the uncertainty and gut feel as it occurred to me in the [notes](./NOTES.md) - and in the commit history too.
